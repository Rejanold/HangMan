1) in the attatched zip file is 3 java files one for game one for hangmanpanel and one for hangmandraw
	to compile and run this program all files must be in the same folder as well as whatever file is
	used for the dictionary, 
2) to run ensure the steps in step 1 and for command line arguments you need to pass
	java Game "filename.txt" being whatever your filename is.
3) the program was extensive and painful, i spent way more time than I should have designing just the
	layout, once i had a good box to work with I began working on implementation of actionListeners 
	and arrays to verify input against the word. after that I did alot of collaborating with my co authors
	to finalise my drawing and implementation.
4) THe program is not complete my understanding of Syntax is limited so i give you what I was able to complete,
	my blank spaces are printing in the incorrect spot for some reason and have no time to debug why,
	the game does not print a winning statement instead it will continue letting you guess until you lose,
	also I am unsure if it was required but I wanted to implement an array toString() method so that
	my guessed letters would not be printed in array style.

Thank you for your hekp during our meeting Professor without that I would not have been able to get this
program to the state that it is, I am close to finishing and will when I have time as well as adding some 
neat features to allow me to play a new game and so on I enjoyed playing with your dictionary file before
writing this readme.

Respectfully,
